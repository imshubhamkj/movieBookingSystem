# movieBookingSystem
The basic objective of the project, Movie Ticket Booking System, is to provide an easy way for users to reserve tickets beforehand for a movie. The plan is to use the basic knowledge of data-structures to implement the project. It will use arrays and linked list to implement the code in C language. The system is very user-friendly and is anticipated that functions of the system will be easily accessed by the customers. This movie ticket booking system is complete atomization of manual system to computerized system. There is full security since nobody except the user himself and the administrator can access his ID and details. They can see which are the current movies, the upcoming movies and the period for which they will remain in the theatre. People have to collect their tickets before an hour of the starting of the show.
